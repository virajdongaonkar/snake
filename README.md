## Snake ##
Welcome to Snake, the classic game of the snake and the apple. This project is built using JavaScript and HTML. I followed guidance from tutorial on http://zetcode.com/javascript/snake to build this project. 

## Background ##
The aim of the game is to move the snake to eat as many apples as possible in the game session before the snake bumps into the border of the world or bumps into the end of itself. The only keys used by the player are the left, right, up, or down arrows of the keyboard. More specifically, the explicit directional keys are used, and not the directional keys on the number pads. The snake can only turn perpendicular to its current position i.e. a snake moving in the right direction cannot flip 180 to move to the left direction. However, if one completes two perpendicular turns in a small amount of time, the snake may appear to flip backwards in this way.

## Running the project ##
This project can be run in two ways. 

One way is by simply visiting the website in which the project is hosted and running it there. The website is: http://game-of-snake.herokuapp.com/

Another way is by downloading the code and running the app locally. To do this, first download the files to your machine by clicking the green "Code" button and unzipping the downloaded zip file. Then, reach the root directory of the source code and open the "index.html" file using any browser. 

For both methods, whenever the game is over, simply refresh the browser to play again!
